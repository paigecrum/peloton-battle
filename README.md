# Peloton Battle App

This is a React/Express App that authenticates you to the Peloton API using your Peloton login credentials (which are not stored). It utilizes the Peloton API to list the recent rides you have taken in common with the people that you follow on Peloton. You can select a ride and choose a friend to battle. Whoever has a higher output for that ride will be displayed as the winner of that battle.
